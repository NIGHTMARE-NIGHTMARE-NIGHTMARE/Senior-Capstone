  utter_greet_and_algo_types:
  - text: "Hey!\nWould you like to learn about search algorithms or sort algorithms?"

  utter_goodbye:
  - text: "Bye"

  utter_out_of_scope:
  - text: "Sorry, I can't handle that request. Do you want help with something else?"

  utter_search_definition_and_pick_type:
  - text: "In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. \nSearch algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure,\nor calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.\n\nHere are the options:\n - Linear Search\n - Binary Search\n - Depth First Search (DFS)\n - Bredth First Search (BFS)\nPlease pick one you want to learn."

  utter_sort_definition_and_pick_type:
  - text: "In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.\nThe most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order,\nand either ascending or descending.\nHere are the options:\n - Quicksort\n - Insertion Sort\n - Bubble Sort\n - Merge Sort\n - Heap Sort\nPlease pick one you want to learn."

  utter_linear_definition_and_more_info_question: 
  - text: "In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element \nwithin a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the \nwhole list has been searched.\n\nDo you want more information on this?"

  utter_quick_definition_and_more_info_question:
  - text: "Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort."
