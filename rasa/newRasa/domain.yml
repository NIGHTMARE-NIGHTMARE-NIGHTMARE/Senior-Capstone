  utter_search_definition:
    - text: "A systematic procedure or method used to locate specific data within a collection or dataset. It involves examining each element of the dataset in a structured manner until the desired data is found or determined to be absent."
    - text: "A computational technique designed to efficiently retrieve information from a data structure. It typically involves evaluating the contents of the data structure and applying predefined rules or conditions to identify the target data."
    - text: "A procedure that navigates through a collection of elements, such as an array or a tree, to locate a particular value or determine its nonexistence. The algorithm's efficiency is measured based on factors such as time complexity and space complexity."

  utter_sort_definition:
    - text: "A procedure used to arrange elements in a specific order within a collection or dataset. It systematically compares and reorganizes elements based on predetermined criteria to achieve ascending or descending order."
    - text: "A computational technique designed to rearrange elements within a data structure in a specified order. It involves comparing elements and swapping their positions based on defined comparison rules to achieve sorted output."
    - text: "A set of instructions or rules that dictate how to organize elements within a dataset into a desired order, such as ascending or descending. It is commonly used in data processing and analysis to facilitate efficient searching, indexing, and retrieval operations."
